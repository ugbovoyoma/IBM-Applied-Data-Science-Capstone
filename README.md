# IBM-Applied-Data-Science-Capstone

This Capstone is the 10th (final) course in IBM Data Science Professional Certificate specialization serving as a hands-on course where i will apply my data science skills to solve real-world challenges. This repository contains all the project files and resources for the capstone project, part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate program on Coursera. This capstone focuses on analyzing SpaceX launch data, to extract insights and build a machine learning model for predicting launch success.



# Project Background
In this capstone, i will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if i can determine if the first stage will land, i can determine the cost of a launch.

# Questions to be answered
- How do variables such as payload mass, launch site, number of flights, and orbits affect the success of the first stage landing?
- Does the rate of successful landings increase over the years?
- What is the best algorithm that can be used for binary classification in this case?

# Methodology
## 1. Data collection methodology
- Using SpaceX Rest API
- Using Web Scrapping from Wikipedia
- 
## 2. Performed data wrangling
- Filtering the data
- Dealing with missing values
- Using One Hot Encoding to prepare the data to a binary classification
- 
## 3. Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using visualization and SQL

## 4. Performed interactive visual analytics using Folium and Plotly Dash

## 5. Performed predictive analysis using classification models
- Building, tuning and evaluation of classification models to ensure the best results
